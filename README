HyperWave::CSP version 0.02

   This module is NOT FINISHED!

   It's not even close to being sort of halfway not finished for an
   alpha release.

   However, some of it -does- work.  Everything in the examples
   directory works more or less, and should give you an idea of how it
   can be used.

   CSP stands for Client-Server-Protocol which is the official name
   for the native HyperWave Protocol.  That also leaves space in the
   namespace for somebody to write a module for the server-server
   protocol.


   Anybody who wants to poke at it is welcome.  Submitting fixes and
   patches is even MORE welcome.  Even if you don't want to program,
   the quickest way of finding about new releases is to tell me you're
   using it and I'll add you to my list of people to be notified.


INSTALLING

   To install it:
      perl Makefile.pl
      make
      make test
      make install

DOCS

   There's .pod form documentation all through the source.  If you want
   to see it in a different format, check the docs/ subdirectory.

KNOWN BUGS
   Apparently the 'make install' tries to put Message.pm into the
   HyperWave/ directory instead of HyperWave/CSP/ where it belongs.
   Just move it.
