HyperWave::CSP version 0.02

This module is NOT FINISHED!

It's not even close to being sort of halfway not finished for an
alpha release.


However, some of it -does- work.  Everything in the examples directory
works more or less, and should give you an idea of how it can be used.


To install it:
   perl Makefile.pl
   make
   make test
   make install


There's .pod form documentation all through the source.  If you want
to see it in a different format, check the docs/ subdirectory.


Anybody who wants to poke at it is welcome.
