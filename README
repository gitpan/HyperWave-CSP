HyperWave::CSP version 0.03.1

   This module is NOT FINISHED!

   It's not even close to being sort of halfway not finished for an
   alpha release.

   However, some of it -does- work.  Everything in the examples
   directory works more or less, and should give you an idea of how it
   can be used.

   CSP stands for Client-Server-Protocol which is the official name
   for the native HyperWave Protocol.  That also leaves space in the
   namespace for somebody to write a module for the server-server
   protocol.


INSTALLING
   To install it:
      perl Makefile.pl
      make
      make test
      make install


DOCS
   There's .pod form documentation all through the source.  If you want
   to see it in a different format, check the docs/ subdirectory.


KNOWN BUGS
   Just that it's unfinished.


DEVELOPING
   Anybody who wants to poke at it is welcome.  Submitting fixes and
   patches is even MORE welcome.

   If you're interested in what's going on, subscribe to the
   development list.  Just mail hw-perl-request@tertius.net.au with
   'subscribe' (no quotes) in the message.  It's standard Majordomo,
   or just poke me <gossamer@tertius.net.au> if it doesn't work.
