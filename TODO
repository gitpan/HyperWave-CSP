There are LOTS of things to do.

Anybody who wants to do them, feel free!  Extra bonus points if you
mail me first <gossamer@tertius.net.au>, or jump on the mailing list
(see the README file) so we don't duplicate effort.

General
   Barfs on multiple attributes with the same name

   Language support isn't finished

   The insert_* functions don't seem to, like, work.  I don't know
   why.  I am perplexed.

new()
   Doesn't support encryption yet.

get_html()
   Doesn't get HTML headers or body tags or stuff.

There's also half a dozen things not implemented - just skeletons in
the CSP.pm file.  Search for the phrase TODO.
